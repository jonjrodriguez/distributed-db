Example (partial script with six steps in which transactions T1 commits,
and one of T3 and T4 may commit)

begin(T1)
begin(T2)
begin(T3)
W(T1, x1,5); W(T3, x2,32)
W(T2, x1,17); — will cause T2 to wait, but the write will go ahead after
T1 commits
end(T1); begin(T4)
W(T4, x4,35); W(T3, x5,21)
W(T4,x2,21); W(T3,x4,23) — One of T3 and T4 these will abort.
